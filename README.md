## Anirudh Mishra

API Docs: [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19697822/2s9Xy2Nrir)
Live Demo: [YouTube, Part 1](https://youtu.be/MPZqCgrCNbg)
Live Demo: [YouTube, Part 2](https://youtu.be/SXivGtwgO6w) (forgot to show implementation of last few features in first video.)

Features:
- SSE for asynchronicity (currently only implemented for the Admin History as shown in the live demo, working on the same for other routes as well).
- Email notifications.
- Various workflow types, with differing acceptance criterias. Admins can assign approval-users for each workflow, as needed.
- Users are notified if approver wants further justification for a request, and can revert back to them.
- etc.
